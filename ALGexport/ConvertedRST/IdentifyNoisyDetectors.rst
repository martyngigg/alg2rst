Description
-----------

The process for this algorithm is:

-  The standard deviation for each pixel within the pre-set range is
   calculated.
-  The mean value and standard deviation of these standard deviation
   values is calculated.
-  Any detector/pixel for which it's standard deviation value satisfied
   the following conditions:

   -  sdev(pixel) < mean(sdevs) - 3 \* sdev(sdevs)
   -  sdev(pixel) > mean(sdevs) + 3 \* sdev(sdevs)
   -  sdev(pixel) < mean(sdevs) \* 0.0001

-  (cont) is considered to be "noisy".

This is repeated three times from the second step.

This uses the `Integration <Integration>`__, `Power <Power>`__ and
`Divide <Divide>`__ algorithms for the first step.

The lower bound for the integration is currently fixed to 2000.

The upper bound for the integration is currently fixed to 19000.
