Description
-----------

Compute the generalised second difference of a spectrum or several
spectra based on the method described by M.A. Mariscotti., Nuclear
Instruments and Methods 50, 309 (1967). Given a spectrum with value yi
(0<=i<n), the generalised second difference corresponds to the second
difference curve, smoothed by averaging each point in the interval
[-m,+m], and applying this procedure z times.
