Description
-----------

Qxy rebins a 2D workspace in units of wavelength into 2D Q. It also
normalises to the solid angle of each detector pixel. The result is
stored in a 2D workspace which two numeric axes, both in units of Q.
SaveNISTDAT save the output of Qxy to an ASCII file that can be read by
