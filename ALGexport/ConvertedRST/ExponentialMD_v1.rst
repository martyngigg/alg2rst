Description
-----------

This executes the exponential function on a MDHistoWorkspace.

The signal :math:`a` becomes :math:`f = e^a`

The error :math:`da` becomes :math:`df^2 = f^2 * da^2`

This algorithm cannot be run on a
`MDEventWorkspace <MDEventWorkspace>`__. Its equivalent on a
`MatrixWorkspace <MatrixWorkspace>`__ is called
`Exponential <Exponential>`__.
