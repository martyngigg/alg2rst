Description
-----------

This algorithm is to enable you to look at an instrument without having
to load a full data file. Instead of loading a data file, it loads the
`InstrumentDefinitionFile <InstrumentDefinitionFile>`__ for the
instrument, which has information about the instrument. The instrument
is referred to as being empty because there is no data associated with
it.
