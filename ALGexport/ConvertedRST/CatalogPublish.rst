Description
-----------

This algorithm allows a user (who is logged into the information
catalog) to publish datafiles or workspaces to investigations of which
they are an investigator.

Datafiles and workspaces that are published are automatically made
private. This means only investigators of that investigation can view
them.

**Parameters Note**

-  A file or workspace can be published, but not both at the same time.
-  When uploading a workspace, it is saved to the default save directory
   as a nexus file. The history of of the workspace is generated and
   saved into a Python script, which is also uploaded alongside the
   datafile of the workspace.
