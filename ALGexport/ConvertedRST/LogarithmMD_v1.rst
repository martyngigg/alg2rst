Description
-----------

This executes the natural logarithm operation on a MDHistoWorkspace.

The signal :math:`a` becomes :math:`f = log(a)`

The error :math:`da` becomes :math:`df^2 = a^2 / da^2`

This algorithm cannot be run on a
`MDEventWorkspace <MDEventWorkspace>`__. Its equivalent on a
`MatrixWorkspace <MatrixWorkspace>`__ is called
`Logarithm <Logarithm>`__.
