Description
-----------

PoldiAutoCorrelation belongs to the family of algorithms used to analyze
POLDI data. It performs the auto-correlation method described in the
POLDI concept paper.

It's possible to apply it to a workspace containing raw data from a
single run or a workspace with merged data from several measurements.
The only requirement is that a correctly configured POLDI instrument is
present in the workspace and that its parameters (detector definition,
chopper parameters, etc.) are in accordance with data dimensions.

How to use algorithm with other algorithms
------------------------------------------

This algorithm is designed to work with other algorithms to proceed
POLDI data.
