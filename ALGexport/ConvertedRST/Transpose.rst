Description
-----------

This algorithm transposes a workspace, so that an N1 x N2 workspace
becomes N2 x N1.

The X-vector-values for the new workspace are taken from the axis value
of the old workspace, which is generaly the spectra number but can be
other values, if say the workspace has gone through ConvertSpectrumAxis.

The new axis values are taken from the previous X-vector-values for the
first specrum in the workspace. For this reason, use with ragged
workspaces is undefined.
