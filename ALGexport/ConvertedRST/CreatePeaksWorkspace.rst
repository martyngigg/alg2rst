Create an empty `PeaksWorkspace <PeaksWorkspace>`__. Use
`LoadIsawPeaks <LoadIsawPeaks>`__ or `FindPeaksMD <FindPeaksMD>`__ to
create a peaks workspace with peaks.

This workspace can serve as a starting point for modifying the
`PeaksWorkspace <PeaksWorkspace>`__, using the GUI or python scripting,
for example.
