Description
-----------

-  A list of vanadium peak positions in d-spacing is used for the
   central peak positions:
   0.5044,0.5191,0.5350,0.5526,0.5936,0.6178,0.6453,0.6768,0.7134,0.7566,0.8089,0.8737,0.9571,1.0701,1.2356,1.5133,2.1401

-  StripPeaks is called by providing the list of vanadium peak
   positions.

-  The vanadium peaks are fit to a function combined from Gaussian and
   linear/quadratic background.
