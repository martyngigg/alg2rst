Description
-----------

The algorithm looks at sample logs ("proton\_charge"), finds the mean,
and rejects any events that occurred during a pulse that was below a
certain percentage of that mean. This effectively removes neutrons from
the background that were measured while the accelerator was not actually
producing neutrons, reducing background noise.
