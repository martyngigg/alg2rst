   Instrument Tree
Create a dummy `calibration file <CalFile>`__ for diffraction focusing
with one group.

Offsets in the file are all sets to zero and all detectors are selected.
Overwrites a calibration file that already exists at the location
specified.

Detectors will be assigned to group one when using AlignDetector or
DiffractionFocussing algorithms.
