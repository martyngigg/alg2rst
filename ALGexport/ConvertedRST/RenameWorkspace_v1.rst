Description
-----------

Renames a workspace to a different name in the data service. If the same
name is provided for input and output then the algorithm will fail with
an error. The Renaming is implemented as a removal of the original
workspace from the data service and re-addition under the new name.

If run on a group workspace, the members of the group will be renamed if
their names follow the pattern groupName\_1, groupName\_2, etc. (they
will be renamed to newName\_1, newname\_2, etc.). Otherwise, only the
group itself will be renamed - the members will keep their previous
names.
