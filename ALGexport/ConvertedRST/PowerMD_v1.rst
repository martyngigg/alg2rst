Description
-----------

This executes the power function on a MDHistoWorkspace.

The signal :math:`a` becomes :math:`f = a^b`

The error :math:`da` becomes :math:`df^2 = f^2 * b^2 * (da^2 / a^2)`

This algorithm cannot be run on a
`MDEventWorkspace <MDEventWorkspace>`__. Its equivalent on a
`MatrixWorkspace <MatrixWorkspace>`__ is called `Power <Power>`__.
