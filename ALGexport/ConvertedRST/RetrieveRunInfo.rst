Description
-----------

Strips the log property values of "inst\_abrv", "run\_number",
"user\_name", "run\_title" and "hd\_dur" from the specified run files,
and compiles a TableWorkspace of the result.

Uses multiple calls to
`CreateLogPropertyTable <CreateLogPropertyTable>`__ create the final
result table.

   Output workspace generated by inspecting runs 12218-12229 and having
   the default instrument set to TOSCA.
Limitations
-----------

Currently, only ISIS instruments with runs that have the *full* list of
log properties are supported.
`CreateLogPropertyTable <CreateLogPropertyTable>`__ is available to
those users who wish to "brew their own" version of this algorithm.
