Description
-----------

This algorithm can be used to change the time-of-flight bins of a
workspace by a specified amount (defined above as the Offset). A
possible use of this algorithm is to correct time bins that have been
recorded incorrectly.

Optionally, the range of spectra can be selected to apply this offset
selectively using the IndexMin and IndexMax properties.

The output workspace will be an exact copy of the input workspace except
for the changed time bins.
