Description
-----------

This method will resample the x-axis with the number of specified bins.
If the XMin and XMax parameters are supplied it will use those as the
range, they can be supplied as a comma delimited list or as a single
value.

The LogBinning option calculates constant delta-X/X binning and rebins
using that.
