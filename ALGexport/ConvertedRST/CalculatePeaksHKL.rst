Description
-----------

Uses the UB matrix on the sample to calculate the Miller indices for all
peaks in the peaks workspace. Unlike `IndexPeaks <IndexPeaks>`__ this
algorithm does not perform any mandatory optimization. This algorithm
does not round the Miller indices to the nearest integer.

Alternatives
------------

`IndexPeaks <IndexPeaks>`__
