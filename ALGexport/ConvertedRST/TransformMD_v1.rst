Description
-----------

This algorithm applies a simple linear transformation to a
`MDWorkspace <MDWorkspace>`__ or
`MDHistoWorkspace <MDHistoWorkspace>`__. This could be used, for
example, to scale the Energy dimension to different units.

Each coordinate is tranformed so that :math:`x'_d = (x_d * s_d) + o_d`
where:

-  d : index of the dimension, from 0 to the number of dimensions
-  s : value of the Scaling parameter
-  o : value of the Offset parameter.

You can specify either a single value for Scaling and Offset, in which
case the same m\_scaling or m\_offset are applied to each dimension; or
you can specify a list with one entry for each dimension.

Notes
^^^^^

The relationship between the workspace and the original
`MDWorkspace <MDWorkspace>`__, for example when the MDHistoWorkspace is
the result of `BinMD <BinMD>`__, is lost. This means that you cannot
re-bin a transformed `MDHistoWorkspace <MDHistoWorkspace>`__.

No units are not modified by this algorithm.

Performance Notes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Performing the operation in-place (input=output) is always faster
   because the first step of the algorithm if NOT in-place is to clone
   the original workspace.
-  For `MDHistoWorkspaces <MDHistoWorkspace>`__ done in-place,
   TransformMD is very quick (no data is modified, just the
   coordinates).
-  For `MDWorkspaces <MDWorkspace>`__, every event's coordinates gets
   modified, so this may take a while for large workspaces.
-  For file-backed `MDWorkspaces <MDWorkspace>`__, you will find much
   better performance if you perform the change in-place (input=output),
   because the data gets written out to disk twice otherwise.
