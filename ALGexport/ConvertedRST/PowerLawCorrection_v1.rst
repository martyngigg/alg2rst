Description
-----------

This algorithm corrects the data and error values on a workspace by the
value of an function of the form :math:`C0 \times x^{C1}`. This formula
is calculated for each data point, with the value of *x* being the
mid-point of the bin in the case of histogram data. The data and error
values are multiplied by the value of this function.
