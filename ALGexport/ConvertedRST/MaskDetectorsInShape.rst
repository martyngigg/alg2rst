Description
-----------

Masks detectors that are contained within a user defined 3 dimensional
shape within the instrument.

The algorithm places the user defined geometric shape within the virtual
instrument and masks any detector detectors that in contained within it.
A detector is considered to be contained it its central location point
is contained within the shape.

ChildAlgorithms used
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MaskDetectorsInShape runs the following algorithms as child algorithms:

-  `FindDetectorsInShape <FindDetectorsInShape>`__ - To determine the
   detectors that are contained in the user defined shape.
-  `MaskDetectors <MaskDetectors>`__ - To mask the detectors found.
