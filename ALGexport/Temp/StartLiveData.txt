The StartLiveData algorithm launches a background job that monitors and processes live data.

The background algorithm started is [[MonitorLiveData]], which simply calls [[LoadLiveData]] at a fixed interval.

For details on the way to specify the data processing steps, see: [[LoadLiveData#Description|LoadLiveData]].

=== Live Plots ===

Once live data monitoring has started, you can open a plot in MantidPlot. For example, you can right-click a workspace and choose "Plot Spectra".

As the data is acquired, this plot updates automatically.

Another way to start plots is to use [[MantidPlot:_Help#Python_Scripting_in_MantidPlot|python MantidPlot commands]].
The StartLiveData algorithm returns after the first chunk of data has been loaded and processed.
This makes it simple to write a script that will open a live plot. For example:

<source lang="python">
StartLiveData(UpdateEvery='1.0',Instrument='FakeEventDataListener',
  ProcessingAlgorithm='Rebin',ProcessingProperties='Params=10e3,1000,60e3;PreserveEvents=1',
  OutputWorkspace='live')
plotSpectrum('live', [0,1])
</source>

=== End-Of-Run Behavior ===

* When the experimenter stops a run, the Live Data Listener receives this as a signal.
* The ''EndRunBehavior'' property specifies what to do when the run ends.
** Restart: the accumulated data from the previous run is discarded as soon as the next chunk of data arrives.
** Stop: live data monitoring ends. It will have to be restarted manually.
** Rename: the previous workspaces are renamed, and monitoring continues with cleared ones. The run number, if found, is used to rename the old workspaces.
*** There is a check for available memory before renaming; if there is not enough memory, the old data is discarded.
* Note that LiveData continues monitoring even if outside of a run (i.e. before a run begins you will still receive live data).

=== Multiple Live Data Sessions ===

It is possible to have multiple live data sessions running at the same time.
Simply call StartLiveData more than once, but make sure to specify unique
names for the ''OutputWorkspace''.

Please note that you may be limited in how much simultaneous processing you
can do by your available memory and CPUs.
