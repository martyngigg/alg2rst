This algorithm is the equivalent of the COLETTE "DISPLAY H/V" command.
It firsts integrates the input workspace, which must contain all the spectra from
the detector of interest - no more and no less (so 128x128 or 192x192), 
between the X values given. Then each row or column is summed between the H/V_Min/Max
values, if given, and the result is a single spectrum of row or column number against
total counts.

==== ChildAlgorithms used ====

The [[Integration]] algorithm is used to sum up each spectrum between XMin & XMax.
