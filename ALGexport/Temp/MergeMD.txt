This algorithm merges several [[MDWorkspace]]s together into one by adding their events together.

The algorithm starts by going through the list of [[MDWorkspace]]s to find the extents
that fully encompass all input workspaces in each dimension.
The number and names of dimensions must match for all input workspaces.

The output workspace is created with these dimensions and the box parameters specified above. Then the events
from each input workspace are appended to the output.

See also: [[MergeMDFiles]], for merging when system memory is too small to keep the entire workspace in memory.
