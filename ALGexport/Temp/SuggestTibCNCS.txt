Suggest possible time independent background range for CNCS. It works for incident energy range from 0.5 to 50 meV. By default TibMax is 500 microseconds before the neutrons arrive at the sample, and TibMin is 3500 microseconds before Tibmax.
This range is moved around if a prompt pulse is in this interval, or it goes below the TOF frame minimum.
