The algorithm ProcessBackground() provides several functions for user to process background to prepare Le Bail Fit.   

==== Simple Remove Peaks ====
This algorithm is designed for refining the background based on the assumption that the all peaks have been fitted reasonably well. Then by removing the peaks by function 'X0 +/- n*FWHM', the rest data points are background in a very high probability.  
 
An arbitrary background function can be fitted against this background by standard optimizer. 

==== Automatic Background Points Selection ====
This feature is designed to select many background points with user's simple input.  
User is required to select only a few background points in the middle of two adjacent peaks.  
Algorithm will fit these few points (''BackgroundPoints'') to a background function of specified type.
