This algorithm is used to load a masking file, which can be in XML format (defined later in this page) or old-styled 
calibration file. 

== Definition of Mask ==
 * If a pixel is masked, it means that the data from this pixel won't be used.  
   In the masking workspace (i.e., [[SpecialWorkspace2D]]), the corresponding value is 1. 
 * If a pixel is NOT masked, it means that the data from this pixel will be used.  
   In the masking workspace (i.e., [[SpecialWorkspace2D]]), the corresponding value is 0.

== File Format ==

==== XML File Format ====
Example 1: 

  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
  <detector-masking>
   <group>
    <detids>3,34-44,47</detids>
    <component>bank123</component>
    <component>bank124</component>
   </group>
  </detector-masking>

==== ISIS File Format ====
Example 2:

  1-3 62-64
  65-67 126-128
  129-131 190-192
  193-195 254-256
  257-259 318-320
  321-323 382-384
  385 387 446 448
  ... ...

All the integers in file of this format are spectrum IDs to mask.  Two spectrum IDs with "-" in between indicate a continuous range of spectra to mask.  It does not matter if there is any space between integer number and "-".  There is no restriction on how the line is structured.  Be noticed that any line starting with a non-digit character, except space, will be treated as a comment line. 

This algorithm loads masking file to a SpecialWorkspace2D/MaskWorkspace.
