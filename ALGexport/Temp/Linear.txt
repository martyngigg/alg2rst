This algorithm fits a line, of the form <math> Y = c0 + c1 X </math>, to the specified part of a particular spectrum. As well as outputting the result to the log (debug level) and as output properties, a 1D workspace is created with the same X bins/points as the fitted spectrum and the value and error on the fit at each point. The covariance matrix is not currently returned as an output: if this is required please contact the development team.
