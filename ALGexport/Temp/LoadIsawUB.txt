Saves the UB matrix in a workspace to an ISAW-style UB matrix ASCII file.

You can use the [[SaveIsawUB]] algorithm to save to this format.

The matrix saved is the transpose of the UB Matrix.
The UB matrix maps the column vector (h,k,l ) to the column vector (q'x,q'y,q'z).
|Q'|=1/dspacing and its coordinates are a right-hand coordinate system where x
is the beam direction and z is vertically upward. (IPNS convention)
