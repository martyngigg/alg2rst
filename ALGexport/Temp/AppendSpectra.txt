This algorithm appends the spectra of two workspaces together.

The output workspace from this algorithm will be a copy of the first
input workspace, to which the data from the second input workspace
will be appended.

Workspace data members other than the data (e.g. instrument etc.) will be copied
from the first input workspace (but if they're not identical anyway,
then you probably shouldn't be using this algorithm!).

==== Restrictions on the input workspace ====

For [[EventWorkspace]]s, there are no restrictions on the input workspaces if ValidateInputs=false.

For [[Workspace2D]]s, the number of bins must be the same in both inputs.

If ValidateInputs is selected, then the input workspaces must also:
* Come from the same instrument
* Have common units
* Have common bin boundaries

==== Spectrum Numbers ====

If there is an overlap in the spectrum numbers of both inputs, then the output
workspace will have its spectrum numbers reset starting at 0 and increasing by
1 for each spectrum.
