Fullprof's resolution file contains the peak profile parameters and some powder diffractometer's geometry related parameters in a certain format.  
This algorithm reads a TableWorkspace containing all the information required by Fullprof's resolution file, and
write out a text file conforming to that resolution file's format.  

== Peak Profile Supported ==
Here is the list of peak profile supported by this algorithm:
* Thermal Neutron Back-to-back Exponential Convoluted with Pseudo-voigt peak profile.

== Instrument Profile Parameter TableWorkspace  ==
TableWorkspace as the input of this algorithm can be generated from ''CreateLeBailFitInput'', ''RefinePowderInstrumentParameters'' or ''LeBailFit''.  
To be noticed that the TableWorkspace output from ''RefinePowderInstrumentParameters'' is usually an intermediate product. 

Input TableWorkspace must have two columns, "Name" and "Value", as column 0 and 1.  There is no restriction on other columns. 

== How to use algorithm with other algorithms ==
This algorithm is designed to work with other algorithms to do Le Bail fit.  The introduction can be found in [[Le Bail Fit]].
