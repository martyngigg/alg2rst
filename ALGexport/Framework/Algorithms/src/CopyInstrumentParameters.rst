Transfer an instrument from a giving workspace to a receiving workspace
for the same instrument.

The instrument in of the receiving workspace is replaced by a copy of
the instrument in the giving workspace and so gains any manipulations
such as calibration done to the instrument in the giving workspace. The
two workspaces can have spectra allocated to their detectors
differently.
